## Question 1 

### 1A

```{julia}

gcm_mean = 20
gcm_std = 3

obs_mean = 15
obs_std = 2

gcm_future_val = 26

corrected_val = obs_mean + (gcm_future_val-gcm_mean)*(obs_std/gcm_std)

println("The corrected value is: ", corrected_val)

```

### 1B


This method corrects the bias within the mean of the GCM as it differs from that of the observations, but scales the bias within the standard deviation.

### 1C

The linear scaling method corrects bias within the mean, but scales bias within the standard deviation.  The skew in the GCM data corresponds to a higher standard deviation than is correct, and linear scaling will not correct this, but will instead exacerbate it.

### 1D

QQ-mapping fixes this problem because, since we are mapping through the quantiles, we're not really looking at the measurement's relation to the mean given the skew as much as we are it's probability of occurrence given whatever that mean and skew is, and then mapping it to a measurement of the same probability within the observed data.  So the skew and the mean don't really matter, their values aren't preserved in the results of our quantile function. 

The role of the quantile function is to map between values and their quantiles.
